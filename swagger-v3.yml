  title: Property Location Service Plus PLSplus QG Version -REST
  description: |
    This Provides the starting point for using the QG (Qld Govt) version of the Property Location Service (PLS) Plus RESTful Implemenation. The service has a sister implementation using SOAP technology. In this document the RESTful version will always be assumed unless specifically stated as the SOAP implementation.The document describes the service functions and provides a roadmap for implementing this functionality into user systems.

    Access to PLSplus-QG is recommended for all government agencies.

    Physical address validation is free of charge, however, users are responsible for their own implementation and supporting services. Application support services are only available to the core service by DNRME.

    The PLSplus-QG service will validate Australian addresses by including matches across unit number, street number, street name, street type, locality, state and postcode. The solution provides users with a selection of address candidates to pick from in the case where there is no exact match. The returned confidence on addresses is mapped as per Table 1 in Section 11.4. A fast AutoComplete address function is available in PLSplus for Queensland addresses. The QG version extends the Public version by the addition of validation of interstate addresses as well as ABS statistical meshblock information for all Australian addresses.

    PLSplus uses addressing standards AS4819 and AS4590 as its base.

    There may be future enhancements, but at this stage it meets the initial specifications as an address service for point of entry confirmation of physical addressing. Any coding to ‘clean up’ returned candidate addresses needs to be performed by client applications consuming the service.


    ## 1) Data Source
    The Queensland Address Management Framework (QAMF) dataset is used to populate the service data source for Queenland addresses. The dataset is maintained by the Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNRME) and updated nightly for use by client applications. Interstate addresses are provided by a third party (paid) service and use the GNAFF.

    The QAMF is the primary source of property location addressing information for Queensland. It is location centric, meaning that addresses can be geocoded against a variety of locations, eg centroid of the property, centroid of the street alignment, entrance of the property and the main building. It is the point of truth for addressing in Queensland and is continually maintained from data supplied by local government authorities (LGA’s).

    Attributes currently stored include&colon;
      * Lot Number
      * Plan Number
      * Geocode
      * Geocode Type
      * Unit Type
      * Unit Number
      * Level
      * Building/Complex Name
      * Street Number
      * Street Name or Property Name
      * Street Suffix
      * Street Type
      * Locality
      * State

    Postcode data is not part of the QAMF but is available from the PLSplus service.

    Note&colon; Users should be aware that not all properties have an address. These include properties where the LGA does not hold an interest, eg a National Park or unallocated Crown Land. Some properties (like gated or Indeginous communities) have multiple addresses within them. Multi-

    Address properties are catered for in PLSplus.

    Interstate addresses is sourced from The GNAF (Geocoded National Address File) which has the same Attributes minus the Plan Number of the property.

    ## 2) Functionality Available

    Under a whole of government agreement approved users may access the following PLS plus functionality for the exclusive benefit of the approved user (Licensed Purpose), free of software licensing costs&colon;
      * Address validation against the QAMF
      * Appending latitude/longitude to an address using the QAMF
      * Appending lot/plan information to an address using the QAMF
      * Looking up addresses in the QAMF from a given lot and plan number
      * Looking up addresses in the QAMF from a given latitude and longitude
      * Australian postcodes
      * Australian mesh blocks (ASGS2011)
      * Failover to a 3rd party provider
      * Interstate address validation through a 3rd party provider.

    Batch processing on the server side is not offered at this point in time. The Qld Geocoder application, used for batching up to 5000 addresses. LotPlans or geocodes, is available at http&colon;//geocode.information.qld.gov.au. The application requires a comma delimited (CSV) file of addresses and uses the ParseAddress, ValidateLotPlan or ValidateCoordinate operations. Full documentation is available at the above URL.Individual validations are also available with the application.

    ## 3) Support Services

    DNRME will supply&colon;
    * Business support&colon; described as granting access to the individual services and general business requests, and
    * Technical support&colon; described as support for the physical environment and associated hardware.

    ## 10) PLSplus-QG at a glance
    * PLSplus is based on Addressing Standards AS AS4819 and AS4590. Users will see major changes in the schema of the responses from original Land XML format.
    * The service requires Method Type &colon;POST and Payload Type &colon;application/json
    * Postcodes (where in use) are returned with addresses.
    * Unit types and Building Level information has been implemented (though not extensive in
    addressing database). A list of unit types is available in Section 11 of this document.
    * Address and geocode type are returned with the response. (PC parcel centroid, BC Building
    Centroid, PAP Property Access Point etc)
    * Confidence values are always returned (see confidence levels Section 11.3.1)
    * A result element called “Metadada” is returned. It shows the “FullAddressString” for Physical
    and Service addresses as well as the “DeliveryTypeCode” and “DeliveryIdentifier” for service
    addresses.
    * Addresses are either Physical (real address) or Mail Service Address (available in PLSplus-
    Premium) and shown respectively.
      * &lt;PhysicalAddressIndicator>Y&lt;/PhysicalAddressIndicator>
      * &lt;PhysicalAddressIndicator>N&lt;/PhysicalAddressIndicator>

    Postcodes where available are supplied as part of the address response. It should be remembered that Postcodes do not form part of an address but are for Australia Post Delivery purposes. There may be some descrepancies with postcode where Australia Post has deviated from approved Locality boundaries. Please note that some parts of Qld (and Australia) do not have a postcode. In these cases the Postcode element is not included in the response.

    ## 10) Versions of the Property Location Service Plus
    The PLSplus has three versions; PLSplus-Public, PLSplus-QG and PLSplus-Premium (DNRME users only). This document covers the PLSplus-QG version.

    This is the Qld Government version of the service. In addition to the operations detailed in Section 12 this version of the service has failover and Interstate address validation. The inclusion of Mesh Blocks (ASGS2011) data is available for address confidence level of 85 or greater. See Sect 15 for confidence mapping.

    ## 11) Elements in ParseAddress and ValidateAddress functions
    See Schema Components for element details

    ## 12) Operations available within PLSplus

    The primary purpose of the Property Location Service plus is to validate uncertain or incomplete information about a parcel (identified by a street address, lot on plan description, geographic coordinate or address string).
    This service provides the following operations&colon;
    * ValidateAddress ^1
    * ParseAddress ^1
    * ValidateLotPlan ^2
    * ValidateCoordinates ^2
    * AutoCompleteAddress ^2

    ^1 All Australian physical addresses with meshblock option (Include) are available for PLSplusQG users.

    ^2 Only information relating to Qld Properties and addresses are available for these operations.

    A successful validation returns other information, such as address, lot on plan, coordinates, and matching confidence level.

    Tip&colon; Using the “AutoCompleteAddress” operation will always deliver a list of up to 50 valid Queensland addresses. Your application could select any of these returned addresses and be passed to ParseAddress and make use of the quick “optimistic” search.

    ## 13) Definitions of Standard Outputs
    ### 13.1) Lot and Plan Number
    The Lot and Plan Number follows the QSIIS Land Parcel Identification Standard. This standard provides a consistent method for uniquely identifying all land parcels in Queensland. In the context of this document, a parcel is understood to be a bounded area in which an interest relating to the land exists or will exist. It is also recognised that such a parcel (or bounded area) may have more than one interest associated with it. Any secondary interest (strata plans) can be validated with PLSplus.
    ### 13.2) Street Address
    The following table shows a mapping between the sub-elements within the Address element and the Address Details of Australian Standard AS4590 – Interchange of Client Information. AS 4590 deals with the interchange of client information - client information such as personal and addressing details - data that is routinely collected by many organisations from their customers/clients and used for contact, logistics and business activity. Address Details are shown in Section 5 of AS 4590.

    ## 14) Acceptable Abbreviations

    ### 14.1) Road Type Abbreviations
      See Component `Road` -> `TypeCode` for full list in its description

      TypeCode is the Abbreviation

    ### 14.2) Acceptable State Names and Abbreviations
      Only the correct spelling is assumed and only these combinations (case sensitive) below&colon;
      * Australian Antarctic Territory – `AAT`, `A A T`
      * Australian Capital Territory – `ACT`, `A C T`
      * NewSouthWales –`NSW`, `N S W`
      * Northern Territory – `NT`, `N T`
      * Queensland – `Q`, `Qld`
      * South Australia – `SA`, `S A`
      * Tasmania – `TAS`
      * Victoria – `VIC`
      * Western Australia – `WA`, `W A`

    #### Tips and Tricks
      1. Not including a “State” in an address, incorrectly spelling “State” name or “State” abbreviation will be interpreted by PLSplusQG as a “Queensland address”.
      2. Any other State name or abbreviation will be interpreted as a Qld address and invoke the Soundex routines and supply surprising results.
      3. Do not use a full stop “.” in any abbreviation.
      4. Postcode can form part of an address.

    ## 15) Confidence Level
      The Confidence Level is a value between 0 – 100 returned in the response for ValidateAddress and ParseAddress requests. It gives the user an understanding of the validity of the requested address. In the response the element name is “Confidence” and it is a value that represents the categories listed in Section 11.3.
      * No confidence is displayed for ValidateLotPlan however a “Count” of 1 could be taken as valid of a confidence of 100.
      * No confidence is displayed for ValidateCoordinate operation which can, in some situations, be problematic, eg high rise building units where all geocoords from the building are projected to ground level. Meshblock information can be “Included” with the request for any service where the option is available.

    ## 19) Error responses

    ### 19.1) Errors
    All errors for all operations will be wrapped in the JSON element. Faults contain the below elements

    <table><thead>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
    <tr><td>reference id</td><td>String</td><td>Id that can be referenced in an incident ticket to aid the support team in identifying the cause of the error</td></tr>
    <tr><td>faultCode</td><td>String</td><td>Fault code (e.g. InvalidRequest)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>faultString</td><td>String</td><td>Fault message</td></tr>
    <tr><td>time</td><td>String</td><td>Time the error occurred</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    The following outlines the errors associated with each of the HTTP Response Code HTTP 200

    For errors returned with a HTTP 200 status, the JSON response payload will contain the below elements.

    * Type - Description
    * `InvalidRequest` - Occurs when one or multiple fields contain invalid data. Refer to the faultString for the specific field that’s causing the error.
    * `ValidationError` - Occurs when payload is missing a required element



    ### 19.2) Fault (HTTP) Codes
    The following highlights other HTTP codes and the possible causes behind the errors. These errors are returned from the transport layer
      * Code - Description
      * `400` - Returned when fields in the JSON payload is incorrectly defined
      * `401` - Returned due to unauthorised access to the service
      * `403` - Returned due to not having enough privileges accessing the
      service. Contact the OpenData if you believe this is incorrect.
      * `404` - Resource not found
      * `405` - Request method type is not allowed. All RESTful operations only allow the HTML POST method
      * `415` - Request payload media type is invalid. All RESTful operations only allow application/json as the media type
      * `422` - An unexpected error occurred on the server. Contact OpenData with the referenceId to further investigation
      * `500` - This error occurred due to the request not conforming to the request format and an error such as an InvalidRequest or
      ValidationError is returned.
      * `503` - The underlying system is unavailable. Contact OpenData with the
      massage id and the time of the error will allow OpenData to diagnose the issue

      1. **Service Not Available**

         Response is given if a component of the operation is unavailable or there is an unexpected system failure.

      2. **The requested operation was rejected + Message**

         Response is returned if the any of the elements are outside of the following parameters 0-9, A-Z, &, /, (, ), ‘, -, #
          * No wildcards can be used

      3. **Lot Number Invalid shown as**
          "faultCode"&colon; "InvalidRequest", <br/>
          "faultString"&colon; "Lot Number Invalid",

          Response is returned if the lot number is either null or does not match with the plan number

      4. **Plan Number Invalid**

          "faultCode"&colon; "InvalidRequest",<br/>
          "faultString"&colon; "Plan Number Invalid",

          Response is given when the plan number uses any characters outside A-Z and 0-9 .

    ### Some example errors
      1. **Service Not Available**

         Response is given if a component of the service is unavailable or there is an unexpected system failure.
      2. **InvalidRequest + Message** (“This request was rejected due to a violation.....)

         Response is returned if the any of the elements are outside of the following parameters 0-9, A-Z, &, /, (, ), ‘, -, # See allowed Metadata Character valid list
            * No wildcards can be used.
            * The message may contain “Street Name”, “Locality” or “Local Government” invalid’.
      3. **No Matches found**

          A “ResultCount”&colon; “0” means no matches were found
      4. **Too Many Results**

         Response is given when the request returns more than 500 responses.

        # Design Requirements
        The ValidateAddress operation validates the existence of a requested address and returns possible addresses that best match the search criteria if no identical match is found.

        The ValidateAddress operation also geocodes the address and returns the geocoded coordinates available in the QAMF database (and Interstate for plusQG users). Parcel information is available for Qld addresses only.

        * MeshblockOption is mandatory and must be either “Include” or “Exclude” (Case sensitive).
        * RoadName is broken into three fields (NAME, TYPE and SUFFIX). The “NAME” is the only
        other mandatory field in the request.
          * RoadName can consist of a “name”,“name and type” or “name and type and suffix”.
             * McCaul
             * McCaul Street
             * McCaul Street North
        * The ValidateAddress operation supports alias locality names (adjoining, neighbouring or "broader area" localities)
        * The ValidateAddress operation flexibly matches road type, road suffix, locality, postcode and local government. Flexibility includes&colon;
        * The ability tohandleabbreviations(roadtypes,suffix).
        * The ability to locate road names that sound similar (first uses its own logic before trying a soundex or similar logarithm).
          * Road names are first tested against locality/locality alias before soundex is used.
          * The ability to support alias or vanity neighbourhood locality names.
          * Ability to recognize Building Level Types and identifiers
          * Ability to recognise Complex/Building names
          * Postcodes (where they exist) are supported for all requests.
        * If a street name (only), without a street type and street suffix is requested, the operation returns all street types for the street name plus all the street suffixes for that street name. The results would the be as such&colon;
          * All street types (and street suffixes) are found for the requested street name and then all locations are returned for that street name, type (and street suffixes). Note that if more than the predefined maximum number of 500 addresses is returned, the response would be “too many results found”.
        * If a street number and street name are requested (but no street type), the operation should find all street types (and street suffix) for the street name and the results would be the following&colon;
          * The street type (and street suffix) is found for the street name.If a match can not be found for the street number – all locations for that street name (and street suffix) are returned. Note that if more than a predefined (user definable) maximum number of addresses is returned, the response would be “too many results found”.
        * If only a building name is requested. The operation will find all building names in the dataset that have a name that best matches (including soundex possibilities) of the requested property name, if there is not an exact match.
        * The following Unit types (steadily increasing in QAMF) are catered for
          * APT(Apartment),FY(Factory),F(Flat),MB(MarineBerth),PTHS(Penthouse),OFF (Office), RM (Room), SHED (Shed), SHOP (Shop), SITE (Site), SL (Stall), SE (Suite), U (Unit), VLLA (Villa), WE (Warehouse).
        * The unit number and street number may be a range of values. Following are examples&colon;
          * 12-24
          * 12A-24
          * 12A-24B
        * The ValidateAddress operation applies flexible matching of addresses. The following is the priorities/process that are followed when determining the staus of an address.

            * Disregard the unit and street number, street type and part and search on street name,
            locality and local government.
            * Disregard the unit and street number, street type and part and locality and search for the requested street name within the local government or adjoining localities.
            * Disregard the unit number, street number, street type, street part, locality and local government and search on the requested street name.
            * Search for the street name with soundex only
            * Search for the street name with soundex and local government name.
            * Search for the street name with soundex, locality with soundex and local government name.
            * Search for the street name with soundex, streettype, locality with soundex and local government name.
            * Search for the street name with soundex, streettype, streetpart, locality with soundex and local government name.
            * Search for the street number,street name with soundex, street type, street part,
            locality with soundex and local government name.
            * Search for unit number, street number, street name with soundex, street type, street part, locality with soundex and local government name.

        The PLSplusQG version offers interstate addressing and the “state” (other than Qld) must be specified for it to be interpreted as a non Qld adrdess. Interstate names must match the list of interstate abbreviations in Section 15.2.

        **For endpoints and Json Request example see Appendix Technical Information**

        Notes about request
        * Physical Addresses only
        * Meshblock Option (“Include” or “Exclude”) must be stipulated. (case sensitive)
        * At least a Street Name or Building Name must be supplied
        * No wildcards allowed
        * All elements are case sensitive
        * If both the locality and local government are entered the locality must be within the local
        government
        * If only a local government name is entered the localities within the local government are
        determined and used in the search
        * A list of locality and local government names recognised by the service can be provided on
        request. Be aware that the list changes regularly.
        * “Alias” Localities are used as substitutes for adjoining or “unapproved” communal named
        localities. Localities sharing the same postcode are also used as “aliases”.

        ## Design Requirements
        The ValidateLotPlan operation validates the existence a “Lot on Plan” description and return any associated addresses and geocode types for that Lot on Plan. **The operation is only functional for Queensland properties.**

        The ValidateLotPlan operation also geocodes the lot on plan and returns the geocoded coordinates of all addresses on the parcel if they have been captured in the address database - PC (parcel centroid), BC (building centroid), PAP (property access point). A full list of geocode types can be found under components Geocode -> TypeCode

        If a valid LotPlan is found and it has no address, the only address fields returned are the geo- coordinates (parcel centroid), locality and local authority. The LOT/PLAN is also returned in the metadata field in leiu of an address, eg Lot 2/WN235, YOWAH QLD. These types of addresses will not be parsed by ParseAddress operation.

        LotPlans validated include base cadastre, strata and volumetric plans

        Notes
        * MeshblockOption must be included for the QG service.
        * Both the Lot and Plan Number must be supplied.
        * The Lot and Plan Number shall follow the QSIIS Land Parcel Identification Standard.
        * No wild cards allowed.

        ## ValidiateLotPlan response
        * A response with “ResultCount”&colon; “1” (or more) means that the Lot/Plan is valid.
        * All addresses contained within the parcel are returned together with the Geocode_type and
        corordinates.
        * A response with “ResultCount”&colon; “0” means the Lot/Plan isn’t valid.

        A successful validation will produce one or more matching address. For each address the following will be returned&colon;
          * The requested Lot on Plan and centroid of the Lot if available. The centroid must be contained within the bounds of the property boundary.
          * The matching Primary addresses and any aliases of the primary addresses.
          * Coordinates attached to the returned addresses, if available, may consist of the following&colon; parcel centroid (PC), building centroid (BC), centroid of street alignment, property access point (PAP), delivery point and any other that may be populated into the future.

        Note&colon; The address for a parcel with no address only contains the Lot/Plan, Locality and Local Government. In the metadata value the “FullAddressString” will display a made up address which includes the valid Lot/Plan and no postcode. **An Address (beginning with “Lot”), cannot be parsed through the ParseAddress operation.**
        * MetaData
          * Name&colon; "FullAddressString" Value"&colon; "Lot 064/B15772 , Normanton QLD "
          * Name&colon; "SiteMetadata", Value&colon; "Strata" identifies the parcel as a “non base” parcel

        Meshblock option “Include” would include the meshblock information.

        Tips and Tricks
        1. This operation is not available for Lot on Plans (Cadastral Parcels) outside the state of Queensland.
        2. A valid parcel will always have a confidence of 100. The meshblock will be supplied with any valid Lot Plan if requested.
        3. A &lt;ResultCount>1&lt;/ResultCount> is a valid parcel while a &lt;ResultCount>0&lt;/ResultCount> is an invalid parcel description.
        4. A valid parcel does not have always has a linked address.

        ## Design Requirements
        The ParseAddress operation validates the existence of a requested address and returns possible addresses that best match the search criteria if no identical match is found.

        The ParseAddress operation also geocodes the address and returns the geocoded coordinates available in the QAMF database (and interstate for plusQG users). Parcel information is available for Qld addresses only.

        A further option to ParseValidate is a mail service address validation. This is only available for accredited users.
        * MeshblockOption is a mandatory and must be either “Include” or “Exclude” (Case sensitive).
        * The RoadName is broken into three fields (NAME, TYPE and SUFFIX). The “NAME” is the
        only other mandatory field in the request.
          * RoadName can consist of a “name”, “nameandtype” or “name and type and suffix”
            * McCaul
            * McCaul Street
            * McCaul Street North
        * The ParseAddress operation supports alias locality names (adjoining, neighbouring or “broader area” localities) for QLD addresses.
        * The ParseAddress operation flexibly matches road type, road suffix, locality, postcode and local government. Flexibility includes&colon;
          * The ability to handle abbreviations (roadtypes, suffix).
          * The ability to locate road names that sound similar (first uses its own logic before trying a soundex or similar logarithm).
          * Roadnames are first tested against locality/locality alias before soundex is used.
          * The ability to support alias or vanity neighbourhood locality names.
          * Ability to recognize Building Names if added to the end of the Request string (enclosed in brackets).
          * Level Types and identifiers can be recognised.
          * Postcodes are supported for all requests.
        * If only a street name without a street type and street suffix is requested, the operation returns all street types for the street name plus all the street suffixes for that street name and the results would be as such&colon;
          * All street types (and street suffixes) are found for the requested street name and then all locations are returned for that street name, type (and street suffixes). Note that if more than the predefined maximum number of 500 addresses is returned, the response would be “too many results found”.
        * If a street number and street name are requested (but no street type), the operation should find all street types (and street suffix) for the street name and the results would be the following&colon;
         * The street type (and street suffix) is found for the street name. If a match cannot be found for the street number – all locations for that street name (and street suffix) are returned. Note that if more than a predefined (user definable) maximum number of addresses is returned, the response would be “too many results found”.
        * If only a building name is requested. The operation will find all building names in the dataset that have a name that best matches (including soundex possibilities) of the requested property name, if there is not an exact match.
        * The following Unit types (steadily increasing in QAMF) are catered for
          * APT(Apartment),FY(Factory),F(Flat),MB(MarineBerth),PTHS(Penthouse),OFF
        (Office), RM (Room), SHED (Shed), SHOP (Shop), SITE (Site), SL (Stall), SE (Suite),
        U (Unit), VLLA (Villa), WE (Warehouse).
        * The unit number and street number may be a range of values. Following are examples&colon;
          * 12-24
          * 12A-24
          * 12A-24B
        * The ParseAddress operation applies flexible matching of addresses. The following is the priorities/process that are followed when determining the staus of an address.
        * Address Logic Process flow - _Optimistic validation_&colon;
          * Assume the address exists and search database for exact match on street number, street name and locality
            * Road based - fuzzy match on roads within locality
            * Road based - fuzzy match on roads within locality alias
            * Full validation (the original process from PLS with some modifications to  improve results – see below for detail)
           * Search by&colon;
              * Road name, type, suffix, locality, local authority
              * Road name, locality, local authority
              * Road name, locality
              * Road name, locality, local authority (soundex on road name)
              * Road name, locality (soundex on road name)
              * Road name, locality (soundex on both)
              * Road name
              * Road name (soundex)
           * If an address does not exact match the requested address the process will follow this logic
              * Disregard the unit number and search on street number, street name (including street type and street part), locality (and alias Locality) and local government.
              * Disregard the unit and street number and search on the street name (including street type and street part), locality and local government.
          * Disregard the unit and street number, street type and part and search on street name, locality and local government.
          * Disregard the unit and street number, street type and part and locality and search for the requested street name within the local government or adjoining localities.
          * Disregard the unit number, street number, street type, street part, locality and local government and search on the requested street name.
          * Search for the street name with soundex only
          * Search for the street name with soundex and local government name.
          * Search for the street name with soundex, locality with soundex and local government name.
          * Search for thestreetnamewithsoundex,streettype,localitywithsoundexandlocal
          government name.
          * Search for thestreetnamewithsoundex,streettype,streetpart,localitywithsoundex
          and local government name.

          * Searchforthestreetnumber,streetnamewithsoundex,streettype,streetpart, locality with soundex and local government name.
          * Searchforunitnumber,streetnumber,streetnamewithsoundex,streettype,street part, locality with soundex and local government name.
        * The PLSplus full version offers interstate addressing and the “state” (other than Qld) must be specified for it to be interpreted as a non Qld address. Interstate names must match the list of interstate abbreviations in Section 15.2. **TODO update to component name**


        #### Notes
        A location record has one primary address but may also have one or many alias addresses. All the addresses are returned in the response.

        A successful validation will produce one or more matching address. For each address the following will be returned&colon;

        * A count (number) of possible candidates
        * The Lot on Plan of the address if available.
        * The matching addresses and any aliases of the primary addresses.
        * Coordinates attached to the returned addresses, if available, may consist of the following geocode types&colon; centroid of property, centroid of street alignment, property access point, delivery point, building centroid, building access point and many others that may be populated into the future.
        * A confidence value

        #### Tips and Tricks
        1. No punctuation is required in the request string for this operation. Refrain from using fullstops as they may cause problems with this operation.
        2. The inclusion of the locality name and State, while not mandatory, is recommended in the request.
        3. The inclusion of a Postcode is not mandatory with this operation. They can be used with Qld and interstate addresses.
        4. Meshblock will not be returned if the confidence level is less than 87

        5. The use of “Lot” or “L” at the beginning of a request, eg L210 1 Lochern Way Bushland Beach, can deliver incorrect candidates in the response. They are best to be avoided as the “Lot” parameter does not form part of an official physical address. When ‘L’ is input at the beginning of a request it is taken as an abbreviation for (building) ‘Level’, not ‘Lot’. Level information data is becoming more evident in address data.
        6. A building or complex name is sometimes the only way to identify a specific address and can now be included as part of the address to be parsed. Building names must be placed inside closed brackets and at the end of the address strring. However, not all building names are in the address database.
            * Eg u5/74 Wardoo St Ashmore QLD 4214 (LORIKEET CIRCUIT), or (MIAMI ICE WORKS)
        7. “Unit types” (SHOP, PENTHOUSE etc) assists in identifying the correct location.
            * A request 8/ 28 Charirlift Avenue MIAMI QLD returns 2 candidates

            * A request Shop 8 28 CHAIRLIFT AVENUE MIAMI returns 1 candidate

        ## Design Requirements
        The ValidateCoordinates operation provides finds the closest address and Parcel description from entered Lat/Lon coordinates. The service searches up to 250m radius from a requested location to find the closest address. The closest point (address site or parcel centroid) will be displayed even if the site has no address, eg a National Park (Lot/Plan) with no address. If no address is found within 250m the co-ordinate is passed to another service to determine the LotPlan, which is used to find an address (using ValidateLotPlan function).

        The ValidateCoordinates operation validates the entered coordinates to ensure that they are contained within a grid that covers Australia.
        * North Latitude&colon; -9.0 West Longitude&colon; 112.0 South Latitude&colon; -44.0 East Longitude&colon; 154.0
        * Coordinates will always be a negative Latitude and a positive Longitude
        * The coordinates will be parsed by the application.
        * The format for latitude and longitude is decimal degrees.
        * Both the Latitude (must be negative “-“) and Longitude must be supplied.
        * MeshblockOption must be included for the QG service.
        * No wildcards allowed

        ### Response ValidateCoordinates
        * A response with "ResultCount"&colon; "1" means that the closest address is displayed.
        * A ResultCount greater than 1 means more than one address has been identified by the LotPlan search (no addresses within 250 metre radius). All addresses inside the parcel are returned together with the Geocode_type and corordinates.
        * A response with "ResultCount"&colon; "0" means the co-ordinates are not in Qld or that there is no LotPlan description near the location entered. Eg. a wide road in outback Qld or inside a waterbody.

        A successful validation will produce one or no matching addresses. For each address the following will be returned&colon;
        * The closest address with its coordinates.
        * The Lot on Plan where address is located. The centroid must be contained within the bounds
        of the property boundary.
        * Any aliases of the primary addresses returned.
        * Coordinates attached to the returned addresses, if available, may consist of the following&colon; Centroid of property, Centroid of street alignment, Point of entry, Delivery point, and any other that may be populated into the future.

        ## Design Requirements
        The AutoCompleteAddress operation is designed to display a list of up to 20 addresses that prempt an address the user may require. All addresses shown are valid and could be captured by an application and used as input to the ParseAddress operation to deliver extra parameters about the address (eg address location, address type, Geocode type etc). The Operation is only valid with the information stored in the Queensland Address database. Interstate addresses will not be found.

        Please note that because of the quirky nature of some addresses in the database a building or complex name when available will be added to the end of the address in parenthesis.

        Tip&colon; When usiing Level or L do not include a space between the Level and Level number

        The AutoComplete operation is not available for addresses outside the state of Queensland.

        #### Tips and Tricks
        1. No punctuation is required in the request string for this operation. Refrain from using fullstops as they will cause problems with this operation.
        2. If after about 8 characters (numbers and characters) no meaningful results are being returned chances are a typo has occurred or the address doesn’t exist.
        3. The service is best used to call an address after a number and part street name are entered. Calling the service before this time will no doubt just produce rubbish candidates and put extra unwarranted load on the service.
